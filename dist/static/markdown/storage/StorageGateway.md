* The service enables **hybrid storage** between **on-premises** environments and the **AWS Cloud**.
* It integrates on-premises enterprise applications and workflows with Amazon’s block and object cloud storage services through industry standard storage protocols.
* The service stores files as native **S3 objects**, archives virtual tapes **in Amazon Glacier**, and stores **EBS Snapshots** generated by the Volume Gateway with Amazon EBS.

## Storage Solutions
* **File Gateway** – supports a **file interface** into **S3** and combines a service and a virtual software appliance.
* **Volume Gateway** – provides cloud-backed storage volumes that you can mount as iSCSI devices from your on-premises application servers.
  * **Cached volumes** – you store your data in S3 and retain a copy of frequently accessed data subsets locally.

  * **Stored volumes** – if you need low-latency access to your entire dataset, first configure your on-premises gateway to store all your data locally. Then asynchronously back up point-in-time snapshots of this data to S3.
