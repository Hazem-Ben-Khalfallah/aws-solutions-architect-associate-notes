* Macie automatically provides an inventory of Amazon S3 buckets including a list of:
  *  unencrypted buckets, 
  *  publicly accessible buckets, 
  *  buckets shared with AWS accounts outside those you have defined in AWS Organizations. 
* Then, Macie applies **machine learning and pattern matching techniques** to the buckets you select to identify and alert you to **sensitive data**, such as **personally identifiable information (PII)**. 
* Macieâ€™s alerts, or findings, can be searched and filtered in the AWS Management Console and sent to Amazon CloudWatch Events for easy integration with existing workflow or event management systems, or to be used in combination with AWS services, such as AWS Step Functions to take automated remediation actions. 
* Help you meet regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (**HIPAA**) and General Data Privacy Regulation (**GDPR**).
