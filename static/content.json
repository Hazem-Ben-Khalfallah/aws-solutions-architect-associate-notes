Example: specifying what the resource (such as EC2) is allowed to access on another resource (S3)\n  Policies - JSON Document that defines one or more permissions\nPolicies can be applied to users, groups and roles\nYou can assign up to 10 managed policies to a single group\nPolicy documents must have a version, and a statement in the body; The statement must consist of:\n  Effects (Allow, Deny),\n  Actions (Which action to allow/deny such a * for all actions), and\n  Resources (affected resources such as * for all resources)\nAll resources can share the same policy document\nThere are 3 different types of roles\n  Service Roles\n  Cross account access roles: Used when you have multiple AWS accounts and another AWS account must interact with the current AWS account.\n  Identity provider access roles: Roles for Facebook, Google or similar Identity providers.\nIn order for a new IAM user to be able to log into the console, the user must have a password set.\nBy default a new users access is only accomplished through the use of the access key/secret key\nIf the users password is a generated password, it also will only be shown at the time of creation.\nCustomizable Console Sign-in link can be configured on the main IAM page (ie aws.yourdomain.com)\nCustomizable Console Sign-in links must be globally unique.

Here you can opt to create a generated or custom password. If generated, there is an option to force the user to set a custom password on next login. Once a generated password has been issued, you can see the password which is the same as the access keys. Its shown once only.\nClick on Policies from the left side menu and choose the policies that you want to apply to your users.

For standard AWS Regions, the partition is aws. If you have resources in other partitions, the partition is aws-partitionname. For example, the partition for resources in the China (Beijing) Region is aws-cn. You cannot delegate access between accounts in different partitions.\nservice identifies the AWS product. For IAM resources, this is always iam.\nregion is the Region the resource resides in. For IAM resources, this is always kept blank.\naccount is the AWS account ID with no hyphens (for example, 123456789012).\nresource is the portion that identifies the specific resource by name.\n\n| Resource or Operation                                  | Default Limit |\n| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |\n| Groups per account                                     | 100           |\n| Instance profiles                                      | 100           |\n| Roles                                                  | 250           |\n| Server Certificates                                    | 20            |\n| Users                                                  | 5000          |\n| Number of policies allowed to attach to a single group | 10            |\n\nCreate a group:\nimages/iam/iam1.png\n\nPolicy: json defined permissions\nimages/iam/iam2.png\n\nIAM roles are a secure way to grant permissions to entities that you trust.\nimages/iam/iam3.png","wordCount":799,"type":"Content"},{"name":"RAM","description":"Share AWS resources with other AWS accounts.","topics":["security","RAM"],"path":"/aws-solutions-architect-associate-notes/securityandidentity/ram","text":"AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) is a service that enables you to easily and securely share AWS resources with any AWS account or within your AWS Organization.\nYou can share the following resources with RAM:\n  AWS Transit Gateways,\n  Subnets,\n  AWS License Manager configurations,\n  Amazon Route 53 Resolver rules.\n\nMany organizations use multiple accounts to create administrative or billing isolation, and to limit the impact of errors. RAM eliminates the need to create duplicate resources in multiple accounts, reducing the operational overhead of managing those resources in every single account you own. You can create resources centrally in a multi-account environment, and use RAM to share those resources across accounts in 3 simple steps:\n\n1- create a Resource Share,\n2- specify resources,\n3- specify principals with whom to share. A principal can be:\n  AWS accounts,\n  organizational units (OU),\n  or an entire organization from AWS Organizations\n\nRAM is available to you at no additional charge (free).\n\nBenefits\nReduce Operational Overhead\nProcure AWS resources centrally, and use RAM to share resources such as subnets or License Manager configurations with other accounts. This eliminates the need to provision duplicate resources in every account in a multi-account environment, reducing the operational overhead of managing those resources in every account.\nImprove Security and Visibility\nRAM leverages existing policies and permissions set in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to govern the consumption of shared resources. RAM also provides comprehensive visibility into shared resources to set alarms and visualize logs through integration with Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail.\n\nOptimize Costs\nSharing resources
