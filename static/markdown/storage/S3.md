## Buckets
* For each bucket, you can:
  * **Control access** to it (create, delete, and list objects in the bucket)
  * View **access logs** for it and its objects
  * Choose the **geographical region** where to store the bucket and its contents.

* **Bucket name** must be a **unique** DNS-compliant name.
  * The name must be unique across **all existing bucket** names in **Amazon S3**.
  * After you create the bucket you cannot change the name.
  * The bucket name is visible in the URL that points to the objects that you’re going to put in your bucket.

* By default, you can create up to **100** buckets in each of your AWS accounts.
* You **can’t change its Region** after creation.
* You can host static websites by configuring your bucket for website hosting.
* You can’t delete an S3 bucket using the Amazon S3 console if the bucket contains 100,000 or more objects. 
* You can’t delete an S3 bucket using the AWS CLI if versioning is enabled.

## Data Consistency Model
* **read-after-write consistency** for **PUTS of new objects** in your S3 bucket in all regions
* **eventual consistency** for **overwrite PUTS** and **DELETES** in all regions

## Storage Classes
For **S3 Standard**, **S3 Standard-IA** and **Glacier** storage classes, your objects are **automatically** stored across **multiple devices** spanning a **minimum of 3 Availability Zones**.

### Frequently Accessed Objects
  * S3 STANDARD for general-purpose storage of frequently accessed data.
  
### Infrequently Accessed Objects
  * **S3 STANDARD_IA** for **long-lived**, but **less frequently** accessed data. It stores the object data **redundantly** across **multiple AZs**.
  * **S3 ONEZONE_IA** stores the object data in only one AZ. Less expensive than STANDARD_IA, but data is not resilient to the physical loss of the AZ.
  * These two storage classes are suitable for objects 
    * **larger than 128 KB** that you plan to store for at **least 30 days**. 
    * If an object is l**ess than 128 KB**, Amazon S3 **charges you for 128 KB**. 
    * If you **delete** an object **before the 30-day minimum**, you are **charged for 30 days**
  
### Intelligent Tiering
  * designed for customers who want to optimize storage costs automatically when data access patterns change, without performance impact or operational overhead. 
  * delivers automatic cost savings by moving data between two access tiers (frequent access and infrequent access) when access patterns change/
  * ideal for data with **unknown** or **changing access patterns**.
  * S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors access patterns and moves objects that have not been accessed for **30 consecutive** days to the **infrequent access** tier. If an object in the infrequent access tier is **accessed later**, it is **automatically** moved back to the **frequent access** tier.
  * There are **no retrieval** fees in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.

### GLACIER
* For **long-term** archive
* Archived objects are **not available for real-time access**. You must **first restore** the objects before you can access them.
* You cannot specify GLACIER as the storage class at the time that you create an object.
* Glacier objects are visible through S3 only.
* Retrieval options:
  * **Expedited**
    * allows you to quickly access your data when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. 
    * For all but the largest archived objects, data accessed are typically made available within **1–5 minutes**.
  * **Standard**
    * allows you to access any of your archived objects within **several hours**. 
    * Standard retrievals typically complete within 3–5 hours. 
    * This is the **default option** for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option.
  * **Bulk**
    * Glacier’s **lowest-cost** retrieval option, enabling you to **retrieve large amounts, even petabytes**, of data inexpensively in **a day**.
    * Bulk retrievals typically complete within 5–12 hours.

### Glacier Deep Archive
* A new Amazon S3 storage class providing secure and durable object storage for long-term retention of data that is accessed **rarely in a year**. 
* S3 Glacier Deep Archive offers the **lowest cost** storage in the cloud, at prices lower than storing and maintaining data in on-premises magnetic tape libraries or archiving data offsite. 
* All objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class are **replicated** and stored across at **least 3** geographically-dispersed AZs, 
* protected by **99.999999999%** durability, 
* can be restored within **12 hours or less**. 
* S3 Glacier Deep Archive also offers a** bulk retrieval** option, where you can retrieve **petabytes** of data within **48 hours**.

## Bucket Configurations
* **Location** Specify the AWS Region where you want S3 to create the bucket.
* **Policy and ACL (access control list)** All your resources are private by default. Use bucket policy and ACL options to grant and manage bucket-level permissions.
* **CORS (cross-origin resource sharing)** You can configure your bucket to allow cross-origin requests.
* **Website** You can configure your bucket for static website hosting.
* **Logging** Logging enables you to track requests for access to your bucket. Each access log record provides details about a single access request, such as the requester, bucket name, request time, request action, response status, and error code, if any.
* **Event notification** You can enable your bucket to send you notifications of specified bucket events.
* **Versioning** AWS recommends VERSIONING AS A BEST PRACTICE to recover objects from being deleted or overwritten by mistake.
* **Lifecycle** You can define lifecycle rules for objects in your bucket that have a well-defined lifecycle.
* **Cross-region Replication**  Cross-region replication is the automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across buckets in different AWS Regions.
* **Tagging** S3 provides the tagging subresource to store and manage tags on a bucket. AWS generates a cost allocation report with usage and costs aggregated by your tags.
* **RequestPayment** By default, the AWS account that creates the bucket (the bucket owner) pays for downloads from the bucket. The bucket owner can specify that the person requesting the download will be charged for the download.
* **Transfer Acceleration** Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. It takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations.

## Objects
* Are **private** by **default**. Grant permissions to other users.
* Each S3 object has :
  * **data**, 
  * a **key**, 
  * and **metadata**.
* You **cannot modify** object **metadata** after object is uploaded.
* Two kinds of metadata
  * System metadata
  * User-defined metadata
    * key-value pair that you provide. 
      *  must **start** with **x-amz-meta**.
* S3 can store objects of size **0** bytes to **5** TB
* You can upload and copy objects of **up to 5 GB** in size in a single operation. 
* For objects **greater than 5 GB up to 5 TB**, you must use the **multipart** upload API.
### Tagging
* You can associate up to **10** tags with an object. 
* Tags associated with an object must have **unique tag keys**.
* tag key can be up to **128** Unicode **characters** in length and 
* tag values can be up to **256** Unicode **characters** in length.
* Key and values are case sensitive.
### Object Delete
* Deleting Objects from a **Version-Enabled** Bucket
  * Specify a non-versioned delete request – specify only the object’s key, and not the version ID.
  * Specify a versioned delete request – specify both the key and also a version ID.
* Deleting Objects from an MFA-Enabled Bucket
  * If you provide an invalid MFA token, the request always fails.
  * If you are not deleting a versioned object, and you don’t provide an MFA token, the delete succeeds.
### S3 Select
* S3 Select is an Amazon S3 capability designed to **pull out only the data you need from an object**, which can dramatically improve the performance and reduce the cost of applications that need to access data in S3.
* Works on objects stored in the following formats:
  * **CSV**
  * **JSON**
  * **Apache Parquet**
  * **BZIP2** compression for **CSV** and **JSON** objects.
* CloudWatch Metrics for S3 Select lets you monitor S3 Select usage for your applications.

### Lifecycle Management
A lifecycle configuration is a set of rules that define actions that is applied to a group of objects.
![images/s3/s3-1.png](static/images/s3/s3-1.png)

* **Transition actions**
  * Define when objects transition to another storage class. 
  * For **S3-IA** and **S3-One-Zone**, the objects must be stored at **least 30 days** in the current storage class before you can transition them to another class.
  ![images/s3/s3-2.gif](static/images/s3/s3-2.gif)
* **Expiration actions** Define when objects expire. S3 deletes expired objects on your behalf.

## Networking
### virtual-hosted style access
Amazon S3 routes any virtual hosted–style requests to the US East (N. Virginia) region by default if you use the endpoint s3.amazonaws.com, instead of the region-specific endpoint.

Format:
http://[bucket].s3.amazonaws.com
http://[bucket].s3 **.** [aws-region].amazonaws.com
http://[bucket].s3 **-** [aws-region].amazonaws.com

### Path-style access (will be Deprecated)
In a path-style URL, the endpoint you use must match the Region in which the bucket resides.

Format:
US East (N. Virginia) Region endpoint: http://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket]
Region-specific endpoint: 
* http://s3 **.** [aws-region].amazonaws.com/[bucket]
* http://s3 **-** [aws-region].amazonaws.com/[bucket]

### Example
In this example, 
* my-bucket1 is a bucket names in us-east-2 region
* /images/image1.jpegis an object key.

These are valid **virtual-hosted style** urls:
* https://my-bucket1.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image1.jpeg
* https://my-bucket1.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/image1.jpeg
* https://my-bucket1.s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/image1.jpeg

These are valid **path-hosted** style urls:
* https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/my-bucket1/images/image1.jpeg
* https://s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/my-bucket1/images/image1.jpeg

## Security
* Policies contain the following:
  * **Resources**: buckets and objects
  * **Actions**: set of operations
  * **Effect** : **allow** or **deny**
  * **Principal**: the account, service or user who is allowed access to the actions and resources in the statement.

### Resource Based Policies
#### Bucket Policies
* Provides centralized access control to buckets and objects based on a variety of conditions:
  *  S3 operations, 
  *  requesters, 
  *  resources, 
  *  and aspects of the request (e.g., IP address).
* Can either add or deny permissions across **all** (or a subset) of objects within a bucket.
* IAM users need additional permissions from root account to perform bucket operations.
* Bucket policies are limited to **20 KB** in size.

#### ACL (Access Control Lists)
* A list of grants identifying grantee and permission granted.
* ACLs use an **S3–specific XML** schema.
* You can grant permissions **only to other AWS accounts**, **not to users** in **your** account.
* You **cannot** grant **conditional** permissions
* You **cannot** explicitly **deny** permissions.
* Object ACLs are limited to **100** granted permissions **per ACL**.
* The only recommended use case for the bucket ACL is to grant write permissions to the S3 Log Delivery group.

![images/s3/s3-3.png](static/images/s3/s3-3.png)

#### User Policies
see [IAM](#/securityandidentity/iam)
![images/s3/s3-4.png](static/images/s3/s3-4.png)

## Versioning
* Use versioning to keep multiple versions of an object in one bucket.
* protects from **unintended overwrites** and **deletions**.
*  archive objects so you have access to previous versions.
* versioning is **disabled** by **default**.
* When you **PUT** an object in a versioning-enabled bucket, the non-current version is not overwritten.
![images/s3/s3-5.png](static/images/s3/s3-5.png)
* When you **DELETE** an object, **all versions remain** in the bucket and Amazon S3 inserts a **delete marker**.
![images/s3/s3-6.png](static/images/s3/s3-6.png)
* Performing a **simple GET** Object request when the **current version** is a **delete marker** returns a **404** Not Found error. 
* You can, however, GET a **non-current version** of an object by specifying its **version ID**.
![images/s3/s3-7.png](static/images/s3/s3-7.png)
* You can permanently delete an object by specifying the version you want to delete. 
* **Only the owner** of an Amazon S3 bucket can permanently **delete a version**.

## Encryption
* **Server-side** Encryption using
  * Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
  * AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS)
  * Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)
* **Client-side** Encryption using
  * AWS KMS-managed customer master key
  * client-side master key

## S3 Events Notification
* To enable notifications, add a notification configuration identifying:
  *  the **events** to be published
  *  the **destinations** where to send the event notifications.
* Can publish following **events**:
  * A new object **created** event
  * An object **removed** event
  * A **Reduced Redundancy Storage** (RRS) object lost event
* Supports the following **destinations** for your events:
  * **SNS** topic
  * **SQS** queue
  * AWS **Lambda**

## Cross Region Replication (CRR)
Enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across buckets in different AWS Regions.
### When to use
* Comply with compliance requirements
* Minimize latency
* Increase operational efficiency
* Maintain object copies under different ownership

### Requirements
* Both **source** and **destination** buckets must have **versioning enabled**.
* The source and destination buckets must be in **different AWS Regions**.
* S3 must have **permissions** to replicate objects from the source bucket to the destination bucket on your behalf.
* the **object owner** must grant the **bucket owner** **READ** and **READ_ACP** permissions with the **object ACL**.

* S3 doesn’t replicate the deletion in the destination bucket. This protects data from malicious deletions.
