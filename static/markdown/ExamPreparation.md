## AWS Certification Exam Guide
Review the [exam guide](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-assoc/AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Associate_Exam-Guide.pdf), which contains the content outline and target audience for the certification exam. Perform a self-assessment to identify your knowledge or skills gaps.

## My Preparation path
* Go through the [ACloudGuru AWS certified solutions architect associate](https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate) course [23.5 *hrs*]
* Go through the [ACloudGuru AWS well architected framework (*)](https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-well-architected-framework) course [4.7 *hrs*]
* Go through the [ACloudGuru AWS RDS (*)](https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-rds) course [3.1 *hrs*]
* Attempt the [practice tests by Neal Davis](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-practice-tests-k/) at Udemy. After each test, note down the concepts I had difficulties with.
* Attempt the [practice tests by Jon Bonso](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c02/) at Udemy. Again, after each test, note down the concepts I had difficulties with.

So you should go through the notes only after you have done a course that explains the basics, such as the one from ACloudGuru.
